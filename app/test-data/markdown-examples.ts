# A Pattern Language

A **book** by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, and Murray Silverstein.

> This is a fundamental view of the world. It says that when you build a thing you cannot merely build that thing in isolation, but must also repair the world around it, and within it, so that the larger world at that one place becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the thing which you make takes its place in the web of nature, as you make it. - [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language)

## Summary

At the core of *A Pattern Language* is the philosophy that in designing their environments people always rely on certain 'languages', which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a formal system which gives them coherence.
